      <p>This web-based, interactive platform records and contextualizes economic activity at the scale in which urban interventions are deployed and experienced. In doing so, the tool captures hard-earned implementation lessons, reveals spatial and temporal patterns of development, and refines our understanding of catalytic investments. The maps of hyper-localized activity contained within the platform do more than visualize data. The relationships between points are themselves an additional form of data: one that correlates development outcomes with the collective actions of the community of stakeholders responsible for the district’s long-term success. Right now, the platform is operating in beta mode. We appreciate your participation in the ongoing data collection efforts—we believe that your working knowledge is critical to the success of future place-based interventions and we thank you for sharing your experience with us!</p>

      <h1 class="ui splash header">About Transformation Development Initiative</h1>

      <p>MassDevelopment's Transformative Development Initiative (TDI) is a development accelerator for Gateway Cities. The initiative acts through Fellows and District Managers to implement locally initiated, catalytic revitalization activities within compact geographies, each no larger than a 5 minute walking radius. Team TDI works in conjunction with local public-private partners to enable sustainable district management, build a vibrant and inclusive public realm, and inspire investments by local residents, entrepreneurs, and businesses, and additional private development—contributions that we call “community co-investment.” Along with program-specific tools in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Transformative Development Fund, TDI deploys existing MassDevelopment finance products and real estate services to encourage development activity by private landowners, enterprises, and investors. The Transformative Development Fund was created within MassDevelopment pursuant to C. 287, Acts of 2014, in August 2014. Twenty-six Gateway Cities were eligible for the program, and in 2014, 10 were selected for the three-year pilot program. These 10 districts are currently in development.</p>

          <label>Ground Floor Vacancy Status:</label>
          <p>
            One of four vacancy classifications is recorded according to annual on the ground observation: Is Vacant Lot, Entirely Vacant, Not Vacant, Partially Vacant.

        <li>
          <label>Upper Floor Vacancy Status:</label>

        <li>
          <label>Site Control:</label>
          <p>
            One of four site control entity types is recorded per Fellow’s working knowledge of the District: MassDevelopment-Controlled, Partner-Controlled, Privately Owned, Publicly Owned. Parcels in question may be confirmed through a methodology to be determined. Please note, “Partner-Controlled” refers to primary TDI District Partners only.

        </li>
        <li>
          <label>Place Type:</label>
          <p>
            User selects the place type that best describes the primary use or activities that occur at the designated location.

          <label>Street Activating:</label>
          <p>
            Places are considered ‘activated’ based upon (i) foot traffic (approx. 5-10 users/ hr; draws users in otherwise quiet street times), ii) positive visual interest (the place/built environment “draws you in”), iii) contribution to the sense of District identity , and (iv) the perception of safety of the area is improved
